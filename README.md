# CUDA Fractal

University project - Parallel and distributed programming

A simple program made in C++ using cuda, for a university homework, that creates a zoom animation on a [julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set). CUDA renders each pixel individually then sends the resulting array to the CPU to display it, using OpenCV.

### TODO:

- Add rendering directly on GPU
- Change coloring

### Sample image from animation:
